# 📚 React Learning Restart

Welcome to my **React Learning Restart** repository! 🎉

This repo is dedicated to **restarting my studies with React**, revisiting concepts, building projects, and experimenting with new ideas. My goal is to refresh my knowledge and sharpen my frontend skills with modern React. ⚛️✨

## 🚀 What you’ll find here

- 📖 Step-by-step guides and notes on React fundamentals  
- 🛠️ Practice projects to apply concepts  
- 🐛 Debugging examples and solutions  
- 💡 Tips, tricks, and best practices I learn along the way

## ✅ Goals

- Rebuild a strong foundation in React  
- Explore new features like hooks, context, and React Router  
- Create reusable components  
- Document everything to help myself (and maybe others!) in the future
